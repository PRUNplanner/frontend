The Upkeep Price Calculator helps you find the most cost-effective materials and buildings to fulfill population upkeep needs (Safety, Health, Comfort, Culture, and Education) on governed planets.

## Building Summary

Shows an overview of each infrastructure building for the selected need, sorted by total cost efficiency. Use this to quickly compare which building is cheapest to operate.

- **Total $/Need**: Sum of $/Need for all materials the building consumes.
- **Daily Cost**: Total daily operating cost of the building.
- **Need/Day**: Amount of need the building provides per day.

A warning icon indicates some materials lack market prices, making the totals incomplete.

## Material Details

Lists all materials consumed by buildings for the selected need, sorted by cost efficiency.

- **$/Need**: Cost per unit of need provided. Lower is better.
- **CX Price**: Market price based on your exchange preferences.
- **Relative Price**: Price a material would need to match the best option's efficiency. If CX Price drops below this, it becomes more efficient.
- **Qty/Day**: Material consumed per day by the building.

Buildings providing multiple needs (like EMC for Safety+Health, or WCE for Health+Comfort) are accounted for in the calculations.
