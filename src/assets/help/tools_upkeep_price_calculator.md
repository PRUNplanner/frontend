The Upkeep Price Calculator helps you find the most cost-effective materials to fulfill population upkeep needs (Safety, Health, Comfort, Culture, and Education) on governed planets.

For each need category, the tool displays all materials consumed by the corresponding infrastructure buildings, sorted by their cost efficiency ($/Need). This allows you to quickly identify which materials provide the best value when supplying planetary infrastructure.

**Key columns explained:**

- **$/Need**: The cost per unit of need provided. Lower is better. Calculated as: `CX Price / (Need Provided / Qty per Day)`.
- **CX Price**: The current market price based on your exchange preferences.
- **Relative Price**: The price a material would need to have to match the efficiency of the best option. If a material's CX Price drops below its Relative Price, it becomes more efficient than the current best choice.
- **Qty/Day**: The quantity of material consumed per day by the building.

The tool considers all infrastructure buildings that provide each need type, including buildings that provide multiple needs (like EMC for Safety and Health, or WCE for Health and Comfort).
