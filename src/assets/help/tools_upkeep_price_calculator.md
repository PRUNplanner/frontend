The Upkeep Price Calculator helps you find the most cost-effective materials and buildings to fulfill population upkeep needs (Safety, Health, Comfort, Culture, and Education) on governed planets.

## Material Details

Lists all materials consumed by buildings for the selected need, sorted by cost efficiency.

- **Material**: The material consumed by the building.
- **Building**: The infrastructure building that consumes the material.
- **$/Need**: Cost per unit of need provided. Lower is better.
- **CX Price**: Market price based on your exchange preferences.
- **Qty/Day**: Material consumed per day by the building.

Materials without a market price are shown at the bottom of the list.

Buildings providing multiple needs (like EMC for Safety+Health, or WCE for Health+Comfort) are accounted for in the calculations.
