Government Tools in PRUNplanner are based on the work Archiel has done with his [Government Helper](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19mg6DKaGi_cfjLNyb8AeS00oddgMbepTDf9RIkOMocw/edit#gid=0).

# Material Price Calculations for Population Upkeep

The tool calculates a fair price for each upkeep material based on the amount of satisfaction it provides, rather than relying on production costs or market prices to represent its "true value" in the context of population upkeep.

The system first identifies the lowest-priced material that can satisfy each specific need (across all buildings that contribute to that need). That material becomes the benchmark for the "price per unit of satisfaction." Other materials in the same need category are then evaluated relative to this benchmark.

The resulting "Relative Price" shows what you’d effectively be paying for each material compared to the cheapest option. Of course, it’s usually not realistic to rely only on the absolute cheapest material, so paying a premium for alternatives is expected. What this gives you is a clear sense of how much extra you’re paying above the baseline. As a rule of thumb, it makes sense to add a reasonable markup when setting buy offers for upkeep materials.
